# Login-Signup-System-Java-GUI
Signup and Login System using Java - Beginner level Java GUI

Working :- 
having two applications , 
The sign up registers a user taking information
The login verifies the credentials and provides details as of given when user was registered

FILES :- 
1. signup.java 
2. login.java
3. users.txt 

The java files work as they look as .
The users.txt is hard coded and hence shouldn't be renamed and the format of storing data must not be altered manuallly ,else could bring errors in signup.java

Have a wonderful day !
Thank You !
